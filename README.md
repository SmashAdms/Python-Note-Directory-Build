# Python-Note-Directory-Build
For this project I created a Python script to generate a leaf directory with 74 subfolders.
First, I create a script called create_notes_drs.py. 
In that file, I defined and called a function called main that does the following:
Creates a directory called CyberSecurity-Notes in the current working directory
Within the CyberSecurity-Notes directory, creates 24 sub-directories (sub-folders), called Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, and so on until up through Week 24
Next it creates 3 sub-directories, called Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3.
This Pythin script was a huge timesaver, allowing me to create over 70 files instantly instead of creating each directory and subfolder by hand.
